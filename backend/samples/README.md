# riscv-samples

Sample RISC-V assembly code.

Code in this folder is written for use with the [jupiter](https://github.com/andrescv/Jupiter) emulator. This means
that it uses all the directives, syscalls, etc. that the emulator uses - you can find more information about this
[here](https://jupitersim.gitbook.io/jupiter/assembler/ecalls).
